Stable release
--------------

To install grbLC, first make sure that your Github account has joined the SLAC-Gamma-Rays organization, then run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/SLAC-Gamma-Rays/grbLC

This is the preferred method to install grbLC, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide
you through the process.

Similarly, if grbLC has been updated and you'd like to use those changes, run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

$ pip install -U git+https://github.com/SLAC-Gamma-Rays/grbLC
